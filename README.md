# tex

Motivation: create a german DIN-standard letter with LaTeX.

The examples use some extra packages like **dinbrief**. It is included in _texlive_.

On xubuntu installing the following packages get everything necessary plus the [TeXworks](http://www.tug.org/texworks) GUI.

> $ sudo apt-get install texworks texlive-latex-extra texlive-lang-german

With that installed the TeX examples can be typeset (compiled) with ease.
